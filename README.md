Profile Generator

This command line application is supposed to take in the Github user name and favorite color of the user,
and dynamically generate a PDF containing various information about their github profile, in their favorite 
color.
I was not able to get a PDF document to generate. Instead, it manifests as an HTML document with "undefined" 
in place of the user's information, and the color does not change. I will continue to work on this project.
Thank you for taking the time to grade it.

Profile Generator

This command line application is supposed to take in the Github user name and favorite color of the user,
and dynamically generate a PDF containing various information about their github profile, in their favorite 
color.
I was not able to get a PDF document to generate. Instead, it manifests as an HTML document with "undefined" 
in place of the user's information, and the color does not change. I have included a gif of what the
application does so far, as well as a console.log of the data returned by the API (proof that I at least got
that to work).
I will continue to work on this project. Thank you for taking the time to grade it.

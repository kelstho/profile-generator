# Profile Generator
![Example Gif](profile_generator.gif)
This is a CLI that takes a Github username and a color using npm inquirer. It will then dynamically generate an html file and a pdf file containing details from said userâ€™s Github account (name, username, bio, picture, location, Github profile, portfolio, number of followers, number of people they follow, number of stars, and number of public repos) with a background that matches the selected color.
